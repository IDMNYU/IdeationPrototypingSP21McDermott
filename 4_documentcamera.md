# Assignment 04: Make a Document Camera -5%

Using cardboard, foam core, acrylic, or another workable material, build a mount which can either hold a mirror up to your webcam, or that can hold your phone above your workspace. 
It is highly recommended you prototype in paper first. 

This assignment serves 2 purposes: 1, it will leave you with a document camera which we can use in class you see your work; 2, it is an opportunity to practice your prototyping skills. If you have access to the Makerspace, you are encouraged to use it. 

Feel free to use this pattern as a [reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ck9VeHbztW8dh6mfwbpIgxGV0nnEbzR/view?usp=sharing) or come up with your own design.  

Post a picture of your camera mount to Discord by 03/03. You will also be asked to briefly present about it in class.
