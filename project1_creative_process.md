# Project 01: Creative Process 

I. Thoroughly research and analyze the design process of a creator from a discipline of your choice. Your research must include at least five academic sources (books, journal articles, museum catalogs), and may include an unlimited amount of non-academic sources (podcasts, documentaries, web articles). 
II. Once you have studied the process of the creator of your choice, make it your own. Apply their process to the creative output of your choosing. For example, if you have chosen to research Edison, who made hundreds of iterations before creating the electric lightbulb, you may choose to create 10 iterations of a design for a robot (for example). If you have chosen Salvador Dalí, whose process included waking himself from sleep repeatedly before painting, you may apply that process to a graphic design project. Your final outcome should be finished and well documented.
III. Present your finished work, as well as the research you conducted on the creator you chose. Cite your sources throughout, and include a bibliography on your last slide in MLA format. Post your work and bibliography to Discord on the day the assignment is due.

The key to your research is a proliferation of references on your subject, particularly interviews, sketchbooks, notebooks, and/or journals or other reflective writing which can give you insights into the research and design processes of your subject.

### Bibliography

*The Wikipedia Disclaimer: Nowadays, wikipedia is often the starting point for research – it’s quick, easy, and provides an acceptable overview of many subjects. However, for serious, sustained research Wikipedia should not be relied upon as a primary source. Use Wikipedia to familiarize yourself with your subject and to locate other sources for further research.*

Remember that you can use as many non-academic sources as you like, such as interviews in magazines and blogs– but you also need at least 5 academic sources (books, journal articles, museum catalogs). Format your bibliography in [Chicago MLA format.](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html)
