# Assignment 01: Constant Output

This is an ongoing project that you will complete throughout the semester. It is an important part of the course that will challenge you to improve your creative process. You will present your first post on Monday 02/08. You __must document your creative process on a website or blog, that you set-up for this class.__ For more information on possible options for setting up your website, visit the [process website page](2_process_website.md)


#### Assignment Details
Create and promote a self-directed creative project using social media and/or analog promotional materials. You must post weekly updates to your process website, but the updates can be small.  

Your project does not need to be digital or visual. It could be aural (including music or soundscapes), culinary, sculptural—there are a gazillion possibilities. You can consider this an opportunity to practice iteration, and designing within constraints (I.E. 14 versions of the same logo design, 1 a week), or as an opportunity to learn a new skill (14 posts on learning to sew). **The main requirement is that it is a creative project.** Use this assignment as an opportunity to work on something you're excited about!
