# Project 3. Designing “Seat belts” for Technology (Individual, or Groups of 2) 

“Every new technology offers an opportunity to ask if it serves our human purposes. From there begins the work of making technology better serve these purposes. It took generations to get nutrition labels on food; it took generations to get speed limits on roads and seat belts and air bags into cars…In the case of communications technology, we have just begun."
- Turkle, Sherry. Reclaiming conversation: The power of talk in a digital age. Penguin, 2016.

Sherry Turkle has said that users will eventually have to demand “seat belts,” for social media technologies–– safety measures that may require activism before they are implemented, parallel to consumer calls for safety measures from the automotive industry in the 1950’s and 1960’s. The question is, what form will “seat belts” for digital and connected technologies take? Further, how might the "seat belts" question reoccur, in other contexts? 

## 1. Identify your technology
*With your group, identify a type of technology which you believe needs a seat belt. As you brainstorm, consider technologies within many different areas: transportation, infrastructure, food production, banking, education technologies, etc. Avoid “locking in” to the first technology you think of.* 

## 2. Research your technology, and develop your future scenario 
Research the history of your chosen technology: when was it invented, by whom and how has it changed over the years? Consider how in a present or future scenario, your chosen technology may be misused or negatively applied. (For example, used in a way that furthers inequality, oppression, harrassment, surveillance, etc...)  

## 3. Develop your seat belt  
Design something to help prevent misuse or that allows the technology to be applied toward a different value. Create studies, drawings, tests, or prototypes for early scheduled feedback. Your design will likely be speculative, so you will need to consider ways to gain feedback on it without fully building it out, such as through a scale model or "Wizard of Oz." 

**Document your design in a way that builds a narrative around it. Recommended: staged or manipulated photograph, short video, or GIF. Your final outcome should be finished and presentation ready. For group work, be prepared to explain how you divided the labor. Due to Discord, 05/05** 

### Tip 
Where project 2 emphasized real world research, project 3 is an opportunity to combine research with creative speculating, and especially to exercise storytelling skills, which are an important feature of communicating your design ideas. 

### Examples from past students
* "Insulated air pod holder to prevent them from being used as a listening device" 
* "Hacks to make government issued masks more equitable and fashionable"
* "Dissolvable toothbrush to prevent DNA theft"
