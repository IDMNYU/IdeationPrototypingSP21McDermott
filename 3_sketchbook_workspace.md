# Assignment 03: Sketchbook and Workplace Set-Up 

**Analog or Digital Sketchbook **

Acquire some kind of bound notebook or sketchbook to collect ideas, questions, loves, hates, inspiration, drawings, photos, visual and textual scraps, ephemera, fragments, imprints, rubbings, stains, odds and endsâ€¦ Choose a notebook that is small enough that you will most likely keep with you (eg. pocket-sized or slightly larger) and use. Make it your own with stickers, markers, paint, collage, whatever. Carry this notebook with you at all times (as well as something to write with and a gluestick or tape) and use it often.

If you choose to do this digitally, I recommend Evernote or Paper by FiftyThree, but you can choose another application. Document your analog notebook on a weekly basis through photos or videos and upload images to your process website. You don't have to document every page, only key pages.

Show that you have acquired a sketchbook by 02/03. 

**Workplace Set-up**

2020-2021 have been years like no other. If you are on campus, you're probably spending less time working in labs and on the IDM floor. If you're home, you may be back in a childhood bedroom, a place you may associate with relaxation. 

Setting up a workspace for inspiration and concentration is integral to building a creative practice. Spend some time setting up a corner of your room or desk to become your "studio space." Give some thought to the work you hope to do this year. Do you want to try stop motion for your constant output? Set-up a paper backdrop and desk lamp. Do you plan to sew? Find a good light source and arrange your tools. Make sure you have a clear wall or pegboard for pinning up post-its, sketches, work-in-progress documentation, etc. 

Post a picture of your workspace to Discord by 02/03. You will also be asked to briefly present about it in class.
