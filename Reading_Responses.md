# Reading Responses 

Reading responses should be short, around 200 words, and should include a question or a point you wish to discuss further in class. Rather than summarizing the text, reading responses should reflect your reaction to or opinion on concepts discussed in the readings. Some of the readings are more dense than others. Try to find an aspect of the chapter that resonates with you, and do a close reading of the portion that you wish to discuss further. 

*Note, skimming can be useful, but if you're going to respond to a portion of a reading in an antagonistic way, make sure you've read it closely enough to be certain you've correctly understood the author's intention.   

### Turning them in

* Post your reading response to the Discord, either directly, or as a link a post on your personal website. 

### Accessing Readings

The majority of readings can be found in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14oJ3xoV8M_B0va-6MnMIWIsuPKn9a4g0?usp=sharing) as a PDF. For NYU E-books and online readings, links are embedded in the [syllabus](Important_Links.md) directly.
