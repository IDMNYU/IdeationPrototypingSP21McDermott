Project 2. City as Site: Research and Prototype (Groups of 2-3) 20%
Part 01: 
Identify an area of infrastructure or public space to research, in each group member’s location. (For example, waste water treatment plants exist in every town, public libraries, bus stops, fire hydrants, parking garages, statues, fences…) In addition to completing general background research through the library and other academic sources, develop and implement a unique research strategy to gain information about your site first-hand. Document this process.
Part 02: Produce a design for the site which builds on existing features, modifying it, or allowing it to have a double function. Projects can be political, interventionist, educational, spiritual, problem-solving, or playful. Final project may take the form of a rendering, model, object, photo or video, (documentation or speculative). Physical interventions should be temporary, and avoid defacement of property. Document your process well, and be prepared to present it, along with your finished work, in class. Your final outcome should be finished and presentation ready.
